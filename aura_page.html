            <p><div>AICTE Launches AURA Scheme to Boost Research Utilization.In a significant move aimed at enhancing
                research capabilities across India, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has introduced
                the AURA (Augmenting Utilization of Research Assets) Scheme. This initiative, launched on Wednesday,
                marks a pivotal step towards maximizing the utilization of publicly-funded research infrastructure.
</div></p>
                <p><div>The AURA Scheme, aligned with the objectives of the Indian Science Technology and Engineering Facilities
                    Map (I-STEM) Official, seeks to facilitate greater access to top-tier research facilities for scholars
                    and researchers nationwide. Under this scheme, full-time faculty members of AICTE-approved institutions,
                    as well as students enrolled in various AICTE scholarship schemes, are eligible to apply.
    </div></p>
               <p> <div>One of the key goals of the AURA Scheme is to augment existing research endeavors by leveraging the
                    extensive R&D infrastructure mapped by I-STEM. By enabling researchers to access state-of-the-art
                    laboratories and facilities located across the country, the scheme aims to foster innovation and
                    accelerate scientific progress.Eligible participants, including faculty members and students, can
                    receive financial support of up to Rs. 2 lakhs for their research projects. This funding, which covers
                    expenses related to the utilization of equipment and facilities registered on the I-STEM Portal, will be
                    reimbursed upon submission of valid payment receipts.</div></p>

               <p> <div>It’s worth noting that each researcher can avail of the AICTE AURA Scheme a maximum of two times during
                    their career, with no age restrictions imposed. The duration of each project funded under the scheme is
                    set at two years, allowing ample time for in-depth research and experimentation.</div>

               <p> <div>Furthermore, the AICTE-AURA Scheme operates on an open deadline basis, ensuring continuous support for
                    research initiatives throughout the year. Participants are encouraged to submit their bills for
                    reimbursement on a half-yearly basis, streamlining the financial process and facilitating smoother
                    project execution.With the launch of the AURA Scheme, AICTE reinforces its commitment to promoting
                    research excellence and innovation in the country. By providing researchers with access to cutting-edge
                    facilities and financial support, this initiative is poised to catalyze scientific breakthroughs and
                    drive India’s progress in the global research landscape. </div></p></p>
